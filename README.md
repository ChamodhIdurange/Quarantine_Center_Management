#### Brief Description of Project - 
Our project is a quarantine center management system that prioritizes patient and staff health beyond others. The systems’ main goal is to improve the efficiency and the safety of all functions available in the quarantine center. This system consists of User management, Staff management, Room management, Food and beverage management, medical test details management, Inventory management, Payment management, and a ticketing system. As this project is a web application it’s a good opportunity to maintain the UpToDate conditions about patients and this helps to overcome the traditional manual database systems and this approach is good to maintain everything in a computer-based manner.
For this project, quarantine center management system our team members chose a set of functionalities, after discussing to create a java-script based web application to overcome the challenges faced in the manual system. We have decided to use MERN stack as the technology, GitHub for the version control, Firebase for tracking analytic and fixing app crashes, sweet alert for creating java-script pop-up boxes, and postman for checking backend connectivity.

#### Technologies used - MERN stack , Git and Github , Firebase , Sweet Alert , Postman , React-Bootstrap , Google APIs
